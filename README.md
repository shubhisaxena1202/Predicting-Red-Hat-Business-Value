## Overview:<br>
  The challenge of this competition is to predict the potential business value of a person who has performed a specific activity.<br>
  The business value outcome is defined by a yes/no field attached to each unique activity in the activity file.<br>
  The outcome field indicates whether or not each person has completed the outcome within a fixed window of time after each unique activity was performed.<br>
  The people file contains all of the unique people (and the corresponding characteristics) that have performed activities over time.<br>
  Each row in the people file represents a unique person. Each person has a unique people_id.<br>
  The activity file contains all of the unique activities (and the corresponding activity characteristics) that each person has performed over time.<br>
  Each row in the activity file represents a unique activity performed by a person on a certain date. Each activity has a unique activity_id.<br>
  
## Results:<br>
  Final model using Neural Networks framework was able to achieve 0.982 accuracy on leaderboard.
